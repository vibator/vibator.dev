# Rule definition

This document is the reference of the rule definition surface: the function
that declares a rule, the shape of a rule, and the types a rule returns, as
they are provided by the base vibator framework. A rule reaches files and
utilities through the [`vibator` namespace](./vibator-namespace.md).

## Reference

- [defineRule](#definerule) — Declare a rule.
- [Rule](#rule) — The shape of a rule.
- [Report](#report) — The result of a rule execution.
- [Diagnostic](#diagnostic) — One finding in a report.
- [Severity](#severity) — The importance of a finding.
- [scope](#scope) — Shared include/exclude options fragment.

## defineRule

Declare a rule.

| Declaration | Description |
|---|---|
| defineRule(rule: [Rule](#rule)): [Rule](#rule) | Declares a rule and infers its options type from the schema. |

## Rule

The shape of a rule. `id`, `title`, and `docs` are required; the rest carry
defaults.

| Declaration | Description |
|---|---|
| id: string | The stable kebab-case identifier, used as the config key. |
| title: string | One line describing what the rule enforces. |
| docs: string | The path to the guideline. |
| severity?: [Severity](#severity) | The default severity. The framework applies `"error"` by default. |
| options?: ZodType\<Options\> | The schema that validates and defaults the rule's config block. |
| check(options: Options): [Report](#report) \| Promise\<[Report](#report)\> | Runs the rule across the files it chooses and returns a report. |
| fix?(options: Options, report: [Report](#report)): void \| Promise\<void\> | Corrects the findings in a report. The framework calls it under `--write`. |

`Options` is the type inferred from the `options` schema. A rule that declares
no schema receives an empty options object.

A `docs` value resolves from the project root, such as
`.vibator/docs/my-rule.md`, or from a package when prefixed with the package
name, such as `vibator:docs/rules/no-deprecated-apis.md`. Scoped names work
the same: `@vibator/biome:docs/rules/biome.md`.

A rule that implements `fix` runs it only when `--write` is enabled. The
framework then drives that rule through a recheck loop, `check` → `fix` →
`check`, and reports whatever findings the final `check` leaves.

## Report

The result of a rule execution. One rule produces one report covering every
file it read.

| Declaration | Description |
|---|---|
| diagnostics: [Diagnostic](#diagnostic)[] | Every finding from the rule execution. |

## Diagnostic

One finding in a report.

| Declaration | Description |
|---|---|
| file?: string | The absolute path of the finding; reporters display it relative to the project root. Omit it for a whole-project finding. |
| line?: number | The start line, or the single line where the finding is. |
| endLine?: number | The last line, when the finding spans several. |
| column?: number | The column where the finding starts. |
| message: string | What the finding reports as wrong. |
| expected?: string | The standard the rule requires. |
| fix?: string | The concrete next action that resolves it. |

## Severity

The importance the framework assigns a finding.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| "error" | Fails the run. |
| "warn" | Reports the finding and keeps the run passing. |
| "off" | Skips the rule. |

## scope

A prebuilt options fragment for file scope. A rule extends it in its `options`
to expose `include` and `exclude` with shared defaults.

| Declaration | Description |
|---|---|
| include: string[] | Glob patterns selecting the files the rule judges. Defaults to `["**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}"]`. |
| exclude: string[] | Glob patterns removed from that selection. Defaults to `["**/*.test.*", "**/*.spec.*"]`. |
