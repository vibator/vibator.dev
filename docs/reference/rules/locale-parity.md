# Every locale carries the same keys as the source

Every locale must define exactly the keys the source locale defines.

## Why it is a rule

Typed translation keys prove a key exists in the source locale. Nothing
proves it was copied to the others, so a key added to one locale alone
silently falls back at runtime for every other language. The problem is
visible only to users of those languages, which is usually nobody on the
team.

## What is expected

Add the key to the source locale, then add the identical key to every other
locale. Copying the source text verbatim is the convention until a
translation arrives; a placeholder in the wrong language is better than a
missing key.

## Keys the source does not have

These are reported too. They are usually a rename applied to one locale but
not the rest.

## Layouts

Two catalog layouts are supported, selected with the `layout` option:

- `directory-per-locale` (default): `locales/<locale>/<namespace>.json`, one
  directory per locale, one JSON file per namespace.
- `file-per-locale`: `locales/<locale>.json`, one flat JSON file per locale.
  Region codes such as `en-US.json` work.

Locales are discovered from the layout. Pass `locales` explicitly to pin the
set, for example when the directory also holds files that are not catalogs.
